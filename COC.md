# Code of conduct

## General guideline:

Developers participating in the projects are expected to enable a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. 

## Standards 

These are some of the standards everyone is expected to follow: 

* Using welcoming and inclusive language 
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences 
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism 
* Focusing on what is best for the community

## Resolving conflicts 

Conflict is not bad, healthy debate and disagreement often yields positive results. However, it is unacceptable to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the projectâ€™s code of conduct. Complaints regarding violation of the code of conduct will be looked at seriously. If a person is found guilty of violating the programme's conduct, be it, mentor or developer, he/she will be banned from the programme with immediate effect.
